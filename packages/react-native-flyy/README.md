# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npm install @config-plugins/react-native-flyy
