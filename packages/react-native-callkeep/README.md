### Add the package to your npm dependencies

> This package cannot be used in the "Expo Go" app because [it requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).

First install the package with yarn, npm, or [`npx expo install`](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/#expo-install).

```
npx expo install react-native-callkeep @config-plugins/react-native-callkeep
```
