        If you leave out sections there is a high likelihood your issue will be
        closed. If you have a question, not a bug report, please post it on our

        Clearly describe what the expected behavior is vs. what is actually
        happening. This should be as short as possible, while still
        communicating all the necessary information. If your summary is just 'X
        library/method isn't working', then you need to continue debugging
        yourself and provide more information.

        This should include as little code as possible, do not simply link your
        entire project. If a reproducible demo is not provided, it is very 
        likely your issue will be closed. Read [here more
        guidance](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

        **Realize that it is up to you to debug your code and be as certain as
        possible that the bug is with Expo, not with your own app.** [Here's an
        excellent guide to debugging you can
        follow](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/5ac00cba0c70b7a06b89a56787d6bc4a).
